WEMON - "The Definitive Monitor" for OSI and UK-101
===== - Started: Apr 26/2019    Updated: June 25/2019

WEMON from Watford Electronics. This is a 4K monitor ROM with advanced full-screen
editing features similar to the Commodore PET.

Current Status:

- Initial disassembly using my CBM-Transfer disassembler, included project file
  is available in the DISASSEMBLY folder
- "wemon-sjg.asm" is the current source. It should assemble with the included
  ACME assembler producing "monitor.bin" output file
- Next step is customizing it.
