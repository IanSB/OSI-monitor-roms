This is a repository of OSI Monitor ROMs.
The first goal is to disassemble each ROM binary back to readable source
and to be able to re-assemble it with the ACME assembler.
The second goal is to be able to customize each with enhancements or
additional features, for example supporting Superboard II Rev D (C1P Series II)
selectable video modes, colour printing etc.
